  \section{Introduction}

In Rumeli Hisarustu, a factory called CMPE250 Factory produces essential products. In the factory, individual units called holders are responsible for handling the products in the factory line. These holders are connected to each other since the product line must meet the given requirements. You are tasked with the organization of this product line.

\section{Details}

 In this project you will be given two classes \texttt{Holder}, \texttt{Product}; and an interface, \texttt{Factory}. You will need to write two new classes \texttt{FactoryImpl}, and \texttt{Project1}. 

\begin{quote}
    
\subsection{\Large\textbf{\texttt{FactoryImpl}}}
    \begin{itemize}
    
    \item The \texttt{Factory} interface should be implemented. The overridden methods should work exactly as described. 
    
    \item This class has three mandatory fields. 
    
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    private Holder first;
    private Holder last;
    private Integer size;
\end{lstlisting}
        

    \item You can add any helper methods you like.
    
    \item Mandatory fields should be correctly modified inside the overridden methods from the \texttt{Factory} interface.
    
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{\Large\textbf{\texttt{Project1}}}
    \begin{itemize}

    \item The main method should be implemented here. This class is the entry point of your program. 

    \end{itemize}

\section{Submission}

Your code will be graded automatically. So it's important that you follow the submission instructions. First, all 5 of your source files, and nothing more, should be collected under \verb|Project1/src|. Then, you should zip the \verb|Project1| folder and rename it to \texttt{p1\_<student$_{id}$>.zip}. This zip file will be submitted through moodle. \\

Please make sure that your program compiles and runs from the terminal line with the \texttt{javac} and \texttt{java} commands respectively. The target version is 17. 

\section{Grading}

Grading of this project is based on the automatic compilation and run and the success of your code in test cases. If your code compiles and runs with no error, then you will get 10\% of the project grade. 40\% of the grade will come from unit tests. We will test each method implementation for the methods in the \texttt{Factory} interface. Each method implementation will have equal weight. The rest of your grade will be the sum of collected points from each test case. Each test case will have equal weight. Maximum project grade is 100\%.

\section{Warnings}

\begin{itemize}

\item All source codes are checked automatically for similarity with other submissions and exercises from previous years. Make sure you write and submit your own code. Any sign of cheating will be penalized by at least -50 points at first attempt and F grade in case of recurrence.

\item Make sure you document your code with necessary inline comments and use meaningful variable names. Do not over-comment, or make your variable names unnecessarily long. This is very important for partial grading.

\item Do not make changes in \texttt{Holder.java}, \texttt{Product.java}, and \texttt{Factory.java}.

\item Do not add any files to the source code except \texttt{Holder.java}, \texttt{Product.java}, \texttt{Factory.java}, \texttt{FactoryImpl.java}, and \texttt{Project1.java}. 

\item Make sure that each method in the \texttt{Factory} interface does the operations it is supposed to do. These methods will be individually unit tested. For example, if there is only one product in the factory and either \verb|RF| or \verb|RL| are called, then both \texttt{first} and \texttt{last} fields should be set to \texttt{null}.

\item All method and field names must be exact. 

\item Make sure that the white-spaces in your output is correct. You can disregard the ones at the end of the line.
